# Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Drinking Water (DW) Risk Viewer

## Overview:

Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in source waters increase the treatment needs of drinking water (DW) systems by introducing cyanotoxins and heightened levels of organic matter. These cyanotoxins and the disinfection by-products (DBPs) which may result from the treatment of organic matter are detrimental to human health and may be distributed to the public through the water supply. With this application, users can interact with several models that investigate the impact of HABs on public drinking water. Users can map various risk scores and view the main factors which contribute to HABs-DW risk. Users can also how alternating different factors related to HABs and drinking water operation can raise or lower the risk to public drinking water.

## Risk Calculations:

This application calculates seven different metrics of risk to drinking water systems: 

1.	HABs-DW Risk: Overall risk metric for a drinking water system to impact the health of humans due to HABs.  It is calculated based on three factors: Hazard, Vulnerability, and Exposure.

2.	Hazard: refers to the risk of HAB production in a source water.  Made up of environmental variables that contribute to HABs: temperature, cyanobacteria, chlorophyll-a, and nutrient inputs from point and non-point sources.

3.	Vulnerability: refers to the risk that drinking water treatment will not sufficiently remove the contaminants introduced by HABs. Made up of drinking water system operational characteristics: treatment technologies present, available alternative sources, history of deficiencies*, administrative issues, compliance or enforcement occurrences, treatment technique violations**.

4.	Exposure: refers to the risk that compromised drinking water will reach and affect many people and is made up of information about the population impacted: population served by the drinking water distribution system, system type, and if the system serves a school or hospital.

5.	Cyan Risk: risk that a drinking water system will have elevated cyanotoxins

6.	DBP Risk: risk that a drinking water system will have health-based violation of the disinfection byproduct standard.

7.	Treat Risk: risk that a drinking water system does not have sufficient / appropriate treatment technologies to address algal toxins in source waters. 

To calculate total HAB-DW risk, each factor is normalized to a score between 0 and 1 and the overall risk is based on a weighted sum across all factors. 

A machine learning model (random forest) is then used to apply the observed risk to predict the risk across all lakes.  

*Deficiency: if a system was cited during sanitary survey for having deficiencies in its source (improperly constructed, nearby contamination), treatment, distribution system, maintenance, or incorrect compliance and monitoring of treatment process.

**Treatment technique violations: A violation of a required process intended to reduce the level of a contaminant in drinking water. (Precursor Removal, Uncovered Reservoir, Surface Water Treatment Rule, Groundwater Treatment Rule, Single Turbidity Exceed, Failure to Filter).

## Interactive Features:

This application provides an interactive zoomable map summarizing locations at the HUC12 scale where public drinking water systems are at risk due to impacts of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in source waters. It also provides a table of the main factors contributing to this risk. 

This application allows users to choose whether they would like to make inferences for lake or river drinking water intakes and which risk metric they would like to model. Users can also test how increasing or decreasing any of the top twenty most important variables in their chosen model will change the risk levels for drinking water supplies and see what factors may be best to adjust when trying to mitigate drinking water system risk.

Once users have made their selections and hit the Update Map button, they can explore a zoomable map which summarizes HAB-DW risk metrics at the 12-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC12) scale, a ranked table of the main factors contributing to this risk, and the performance of the model they selected.

This work contributes to the scientific understanding of factors (e.g., system operation, or lake morphology and chemistry, climate, watershed characteristics, land use, nutrient inputs, and antecedent conditions) that contribute to public drinking water system risk due to HABs. This is an important tool for those who wish to develop mitigation strategies for dealing with the increasing threat of HABs to freshwater resources.
